🏦 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking risks and financial health indicators through an interactive Power BI dashboard. With rising concerns around loan defaults, credit risk, and regulatory compliance, financial institutions need smarter tools to monitor and mitigate risk exposure.

I designed this dashboard to enable risk analysts and decision-makers to monitor real-time risk metrics, segment customers by risk level, and evaluate the health of credit portfolios across time.

Segment customers by risk profile using historical financial behavior and default patterns.

Provide real-time, drillable reports for portfolio health monitoring and loss forecasting.

📊 Key Features
📌 Interactive Dashboard with filters for region, product type, and risk grade.

📉 Tracks Loan Performance, Default Rates, and Risk Segments across time.

💡 Identifies high-risk customer clusters for proactive credit control.

📈 Trend analysis for delinquency, exposure at default, and recovery rates.

🧠 Custom insights built beyond the scope of the base dataset to support strategic decision-making.

📂 Dataset
Contains anonymized banking data including customer demographics, loan details, repayment history, and risk grades.

Preprocessed in Excel and modeled using Power BI for optimized performance.

🚀 Outcome
The dashboard empowers financial institutions with actionable insights into portfolio risk and helps reduce credit losses through proactive data-driven decisions.
